    "Reason for Referral": """
Lucy Brown is a 14-year-old, right-handed girl with a history of brain tumor (left temporal anaplastic astrocytoma) 
who was seen for a comprehensive neuropsychological evaluation due to the associated risks for cognitive deficits. 
Testing was conducted to determine her current level of cognitive functioning and to provide related recommendations 
for therapeutic intervention and educational planning, particularly in advance of her transition to high school.
""",

    "Background Info Header": """
Background information was obtained through a telemedicine interview with Lucy and her mother, Ann Brown, as well as a review of available medical and school records.
""",

    "Concerns Prompting This Evaluation": """
Lucy reported noticing no major changes in her thinking skills post brain tumor diagnosis, although her mother noted 
this was complicated by timing given its co-occurrence with COVID and the transition to middle school. However, Lucy 
reported current memory difficulties, aided by repetition and review. Additionally, her mother reported slowed pacing, 
seemingly across activities.

Lucy is doing well academically, earning A's and high B's, albeit with substantial effort (e.g., 2 - 3 hours dedicated 
to homework per night). She struggles some with math, social studies, and writing, attributed to memory (e.g., for old 
math rules), organizational demands (e.g., knowing where to start on writing tasks), and grammar.

She does not receive formal school supports although her teachers are responsive and flexible, aided by the fact that 
she has been at the same private school throughout her education. Moreover, she displays good self-direction, for 
example working on assignments in advance to avoid accumulating work and creating her own flash cards (which she cited 
as particularly helpful when studying).

She is a good athlete and involved in several sports (hockey, basketball), adding to her time demands. When she has 
free time, she enjoys art (painting, crafts, crochet) and playing with her puppy.

Lucy reported mixed feelings about high school, citing excitement to meet new people but worries about the academic demands. 
Socially, she has good friends through both her school and hockey team. She reported some “mean girl” behavior in her class, 
which she appears to handle well (per her mother, she does not internalize it and will occasionally stand up for herself and others).

Emotionally, Lucy described her typical mood as happy. She denied marked anxiety but acknowledged some stress, related to 
balancing school and sports. Her mother noted that she appears to be coping with her medical history well, with anxiety early 
on but no persisting negativity. Her mother also noted her to have a number of strengths, describing her as kind, compassionate, 
respectful, honest, and friendly.

    "Medical History": """
Lucy was diagnosed with a brain tumor in MONTH YEAR at 10 years of age, after presenting
with generalized tonic-clonic seizures.  Neuroimaging revealed a left temporal lesion with no mass effect or hydrocephalus, 
confirmed on biopsy as grade 3 anaplastic astrocytoma.  She was treated per protocol ACNS1721 (off study), with focal photon 
radiation (55.8 Gy) and prolonged chemotherapy (dexamethasone until MONTH YEAR, then dabrafenib/trametinib until MONTH YEAR).  
Shortly after completing treatment, surveillance imaging revealed progression with local and lemptomeningeal spread, prompting 
repeat resection in MONTH YEAR and renewed chemotherapy (dabrafenib, trametinib).  Notably, she sustained a broken clavicle 
while playing hockey at around the same time.

Lucy's additional medical history is notable for allergies and past anxiety managed with Ativan.  Her current medications include 
trametinib, dabrafenib, Keppra, cetirizine, montelukast, and albuterol sulfate.
